### EXERCISE 1 ###
"""
This API is called 'Open Notify' http://open-notify.org/
It gives access to data about the Intrnational Space NASA station!
This API DOES NOT require authentication,

TASK: Make a call to the API endpoint to get live information about astronauts in space

"""

import requests
from pprint import pprint as pp

response = requests.get(endpoint1) # making a call to the API

print(response.status_code)  # make sure that your connection status code is 200, which means success!

data = response.json()  # lets see what data about people in space we get back from the API response
pp(data)

# let's extract data from the response and write it to a file
# we need section 'people' from json, which is a list of dict, so...
# we also need to extract name from each dict item in that list

with open('astronauts.txt', 'w') as text_file:
    for item in data['people']:
        text_file.write(item['name'] + '\n') # added new line character, so each name appears on a new line.

### EXERCISE 2 ###
"""
TASK: Make a call with a 'PAYLOAD' (special requirements) to the API endpoint
"""

# this endpoint tells us timings when the international space station will pass over a **given location** on Earth
endpoint2 = 'http://api.open-notify.org/iss-pass.json'

# As an input the API expects a latitude/longitude pair for the location of our interst
# Let's make a dictionary with these parameters, and then include them into our call to the API
payload = { # these are coordinates for London
    'lat': 51.507,
    'lon': 0.1278

#     'lon': -74,
# }

### EXERCISE 3 ###
"""
TASK: Writing a log file to monitor the movement of ISS

Make a call to the API to get the current location for the International Space Station
See what data you get back
Convert the 'timestamp' from the response into readable date and time format
Write a log to the new file that captures time and ISS's location.

### EXERCISE 4 -- DEMO (as requires Authentication key ###
"""
This API is called 'Open Weather Map' http://api.openweathermap.org
It gives access to data about weather at different locations in the world and much more!
This API DOES require authentication! But it is FREE to register.
In order to get some data back, you need to use a unique 'Authentication Key'
It is VERY COMMON for many APIs to use authentication, especially in the professional world.

### EXERCISE 5 ###
"""
This API is called 'Pokéapi' pokeapi.co/
It gives access to data about Pokémons
This API is free and does not require any authentication!

Each Pokemon has a number that identifies it

You can retrieve information about different Pokemon from urls

### EXERCISE 6 ###
"""
 Get the height and weight of a specific Pokemon and print the output

!!! Extension !!!: Print the names of all of a specific Pokemon's moves

PRINT THE HEIGHT HERE
PRINT THE WEIGHT HERE

""" EXTENSION  """
# ADD THE SOLUTION HERE
# HINT: you can (and probably should :D) use a for loop to iterate over the moves. Try to store all moves in a variable and see what it looks like.
